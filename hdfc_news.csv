On this high base, LIC reported 54 percent decline in November 2020., Among private insurers, HDFC Life, Max Life and Tata AIA performed better than the industry while ICICI Prudential Life and Aditya Birla Sun Life were weak., Other insurers like SBI Life and Bajaj Allianz Life were broadly in line with industry averages. The Kotak report said that equity mutual funds reported sharp outflows likely due to profit booking., , Among the different business segments, the share of single premium dropped to 47 percent in November 2020 from 50 percent in October 2020. The Kotak report said the marginal decline in share of single premiums likely indicates some moderation in pace of growth of annuity or lump sum payout products., , In the group business, the private players’ market share in group business was broadly flat month-on-month at 24 percent in November 2020. Among major private players, Bajaj Life, HDFC Life and SBI Life lost marginal marketshare in group business on a month-on-month basis while it increased for Aditya Birla Sun Life and ICICI Prudential Life.",no time

Take a look:, Brokerage: HDFC Securities, Cadila Healthcare | Buy | LTP: Rs 429.40 | Target price: Rs 508 | Upside: 18%, As per the brokerage firm, the company's domestic and wellness businesses should grow in the high single digits and low-mid teens, respectively., The stabilisation in the price erosion in the US generics business coupled with a strong pipeline would drive growth in the US business., It has reduced net debt by Rs 2700 crore to Rs 4030 crore through fundraising of Rs 1000 crore (at the Zydus Wellness level) and a better working capital cycle in H1FY21., ""We estimate revenue CAGR of 8 percent over FY20-22E led by strong growth from wellness business, US market and domestic formulations. We project 150bps margin expansion led by gross margin expansion and operational efficiencies over FY20-22E,"" said the brokerage., Healthy revenues, better operating performance and lower interest expenses could drive 16 percent PAT CAGR over the same period., United Spirits | Buy | LTP: Rs 553.25 | Target price: Rs 645 | Upside: 17%, United Spirits has been severely impacted by the pandemic due to government restrictions., United Spirits, being the market leader, is expected to recover faster than peers on the back of a recovery in trade business, increase in at-home consumption, festive season sales, resumption in duty-free sales and benign commodity inflation., ""We recommend a buy on the stock at the current market price and add on declines to Rs 510-491 for a target of Rs 645 valuing the company at 52 times FY22 EPS,"" said the company., Brokerage: Nirmal Bang’s Institutional Equities Research, HCL Technologies | Buy | LTP: Rs 830.50 | Target price: Rs 1,053 | Upside: 27%, The brokerage believes HCL Technologies will be an outsized beneficiary of the digital infrastructure build-out that has been catalyzed by the pandemic and which will likely be a 3-5 year opportunity., HCL Tech has the highest leverage to this opportunity among Indian players with what we estimate to be a 30 percent revenue exposure., HCL Tech will also benefit from a pick-up in Digital transformation spends on both services (Mode-2) and products (Mode-3). This will likely help the company deliver growth outperformance in an industry that will likely see growth acceleration of 300-400bps after delivering 6-8 percent organic growth over FY15-FY20., The brokerage values HCL Tech at a target P/E of 18.8 times September 2022E EPS, which is at a 25 percent discount to the target P/E multiple of TCS., Hindustan Unilever (HUL) | Buy | LTP: Rs 2,188 | Target price: Rs 2,555 | Upside: 17%, The brokerage firm believes that HUL offers the best earnings growth visibility in the large-cap Indian consumer space, justifying premium valuation even though return ratios have dropped due to the impact of the merger., Sun Pharmaceutical Industries | Buy | LTP: Rs 514 | Target price: Rs 618 | Upside: 20%, The brokerage believes the US business for Sun Pharma (excluding Taro Pharmaceuticals and Dusa Pharmaceuticals) should start growing as 92 ANDAs (abbreviated new drug applications) and 6 NDAs, which are pending approval, gradually start reflecting in incremental revenues., Price erosion in base business is unlikely to be painful as the same is now commoditised with a median competitive intensity of eight players across its marketed ANDA portfolio., In addition to complex ANDAs, Sun Pharma is also aggressively developing value-added generic drugs that are targeting the following segments: 1) Patients suffering from dysphagia. 2) Dosing convenience. 3) Improved health care administration., The domestic business should deliver a low double-digit growth and outpace the Indian pharmaceutical market driven by its large exposure to the chronic segment. the brokerage said., UltraTech Cement | Buy | LTP: Rs 4,890.25 | Target price: Rs 5,640 | Upside: 15%, Over the last 2 years, UltraTech has acquired Binani Cement (renamed as UltraTech Nathdwara) as well as Century Textile’s Cement division., For Q2FY21, Century’s EBITDA/mt was in excess of Rs 700 and capacity utilization at 68 percent. Ultratech Nathdwara’s capacity utilisation stood at 60 percent and EBITDA/mt at more than Rs 1,500., ""We are building in 5 percent/7 percent/16 percent CAGR in revenue/EBITDA/PAT for the company over FY20- FY23E,"" said the brokerage., Analyst: Narendra Solanki, Head- Equity Research (Fundamental), Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, Dr.Reddy's Laboratories | Buy | LTP: Rs 4,875.60 | Target price: Rs 6,012 | Upside: 23%, Dr. Reddy’s offers an array of the portfolio of products and services, including APIs, custom pharmaceutical services, generics, biosimilars and differentiated formulations., As of now, 101 generic filings are pending for approval with the USFDA comprising 99 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) and 2 NDAs., Also, the company expects 28 filings to have first to file status., In a major development, the company settled litigation with Celgene, relating to patents for REVLIMID Capsules. Celgene has agreed to provide Dr.Reddy’s with a license to sell volume-limited amounts in the US post-March 2022 and without volume limitation beginning on Jan 31, 2026, subject to regulatory approval., The latest settlement provides significant revenue opportunities to the company in the $7.6 billion REVLIMID market with few players., The company remains on track to launch over 25 new products including some niche and limited competition products in its North America Generics business in FY21., ""While the company should benefit from the gradual price stabilization in US business, we expect growth across markets driven by an increase in volume and continued new launches,"" said the analyst., Also, recent market developments signal the potential for the expansion of its API business. The analyst is optimistic given the company’s strong balance sheet and management's focus on building a healthy product pipeline, improving efficiency, controlling costs and streamlining operations., Hero MotoCorp | Buy | LTP: Rs 3,105 | Target price: Rs 3,653 | Upside: 18%, The two-wheeler industry is witnessing high demand due to the lack of public transport availability & social distancing norms in place due to COVID-19., The company is currently operating at nearly 100 percent production capacity with almost all customer touchpoints open., With the peak festival season coming up in the months of October and November, the company’s management is positive about achieving high sales numbers with the help of positive consumer sentiments., ""With the improvement in demand and improving macro-economic data especially from rural areas, we believe the auto 2-wheeler industry is set to bounce back faster and Hero Moto being a market leader in its segment should also benefit in medium-term,"" said the analyst., Bharti Airtel | Buy | LTP: Rs 479.90 | Target price: Rs 625 | Upside: 30%, The analyst believes Bharti Airtel is poised for decent ARPU growth for India Mobile business though there might be some short term impact on 4G subscriber additions., Revenue prospects look promising with improving performance in the Africa business. Further, with revenue market share gain and decent network capacity compared to peers, the company is well placed for long term growth in the telecom space., The company remains focused on expanding networks, extending coverage particularly in rural areas, along with continued investments in data centers, home broadband and other lines of business., The company is also refarming almost all of its spectrum, hence all 3G spectrum is moving to 4G., The management expects moderation of CAPEX in FY21 compared to FY20. Recently, the company inked a deal with a global investment firm, The Carlyle Group, under which the latter will invest US$235 million in Nxtra Data Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bharti Airtel engaged in the data center business., The company looks to benefit from this investment given Carlyle’s prior experience in data centre ownership through investments in Coresite in the US and Itconic in Spain., HDFC Life Insurance Company | Buy | LTP: Rs 635.55 | Target price: Rs 685 | Upside: 8%, Life insurance has emerged as an important avenue for both protection as well as long-term savings products., The management stated that the company has been experiencing growth in renewal with normalization being witnessed in premium collection rates., The company reported a 34.8 percent year-over-year increase in gross premium to Rs 10,182.5 crore in Q2FY21, driven by strong growth in new business premium as well as renewal premium., As of September 30, 2020, the Assets Under Management (AUM) stood at Rs 150.6 crore, increasing 15 percent YoY., The company’s market share in terms of Individual Weighted received premium (WRP) grew by 235bps to 17.5 percent., Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

Take a look:, HDFC Life Insurance, HDFC Life is a strong contender in the life insurance space and even after a weak Q1 performance with a 30 percent decline in premiums, HDFC Life surpassed its peers with a stellar 21 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in new premiums in the second quarter., As a front-runner in the protection segment through its Banca channel, HDFC Life is efficiently leveraging its first-mover advantage., Favorable product mix and repricing of protection products have also aided in margin expansion. Amidst the pandemic, a 25-26 percent margin guidance for FY21 by the management seems achievable, hence HDFC Life could be a strong compounding story., Moreover, its moat lies in the powerful brand, qualified management, strong return and persistency ratios, improved solvency ratio and higher operating ROEV., Pidilite Industries, Pidilite Industries is the leader in the domestic market for adhesives, sealants and construction chemicals., Its product portfolio has high recall among consumers which enables a strong market leadership and demand for brands such as Fevicol, Dr.Fixit and Fevikwik., A recent acquisition of the maker of Araldite is further expected to strengthen its leadership in the adhesive space. The huge scope of growth from the construction chemicals industry builds confidence in Pidilite's future outlook., A unique moat enables it to deliver robust financial performance with 18 percent CAGR growth in PAT over 5 years and rich cash flow generation with OCF at Rs 1,280 crore and FCF at Rs 827 crore seen in FY20., Overall, a well-rounded company with an identifiable brand presence and robust financials make Pidilite Industries a wealth generator for investors., Bharat Rasayan, When most industries were impacted due to lockdowns, a few agri-businesses managed to escape. Bharat Rasayan, a leading maker of technical-grade pesticides in India, is one of them., As farming-related activities continued, demand for pesticides continued to remain strong which allowed the company to maintain robust operating margins in the range of 18-23 percent., It has also delivered an exemplary revenue CAGR of 23 percent over the past 5 years with strong cash flow generation., Bharat Rasayan is expected to grow at the current pace given the growing market opportunity and superior R&D capabilities facilitating innovation and high margin product development., Even amidst a challenging scenario, it has a strong product portfolio, vast distribution network and brand equity which enable steady performance., All these factors coupled with attractive valuations enable strong returns to shareholders., Larsen & Toubro, The lockdown impacted its core engineering business but the IT business flourished as digitization and cloud-adaptation became the norm for companies globally, resulting in strong financial performance from this segment., What guides L&T's future is its magnificent order book including a Rs 24,985 crore deal for developing a 237km-line for Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train with long-term revenue prospects., The stock has taken quite the battering which makes it attractive from a valuation perspective and very limited scope for further downside., Attractive margins, stable free cashflows, robust order book, recovery in engineering business and large opportunities from the defence segment make L&T a compelling addition to the portfolio., Bharti Airtel, In the telecom sector's largely duopoly environment, Bharti is well-positioned to serve the premium end of the subscriber base and continues to gain market share in top-end subscribers, driving superior ARPUs., The recently concluded fundraising of Rs 550 crore via QIP/rights issue and a stake sale of the Africa business aided in making its balance sheet resilient to stressful times., Bharti can also consider monetizing its 53.51 percent stake in Bharti Infratel in the future to invest in 5G and future technologies., With a sound business model of a partnership approach rather than an ownership approach, Bharti can leverage its growing partner ecosystem to build digital assets and compete against the mightyReliance Jio., With rising ARPUs, robust EBITDA performance, contained debt levels, a large asset base, Bharti seems to be in a sweet spot with a strong growth outlook from an investment perspective., Kotak Mahindra Bank, This bank has always maintained a very conservative stance and its actions such as providing for nearly 177 percent of its total net NPA reflect the same conservative approach which seems adequate amidst a contracting economy., Going forward, the management aims to focus on its asset engine for growth while maintaining a resilient capital position., Not only does Kotak have robust NIMs, comfortable asset quality and a top-notch liability franchise, it also has adequate margin levers. RBI's ruling on the restructuring of loans and deferment in reporting NPLs post-August will surely delay the true asset deterioration but even then Kotak seems to have an upper hand in managing its assets well with prudent risk management., It seems to be hitting all the right nerves to be regarded as a strong contender to ride the COVID wave., HDFC, This NBFC mammoth has a long-standing track record of operations, adequate capitalisation levels, strong resource raising ability, stringent underwriting standards and top-notch risk management procedures., Despite facing a hard hit in its retail lending business due to national lockdowns, HDFC has efficiently managed to bring about recovery in its numbers this quarter., In fact, the disbursements in October 2020 were the second-highest in HDFC's history., The environment down the road seems conducive for the housing finance sector given the low-interest rates, softer property prices, reduction in stamp duty in certain states and inherent strong demand for home loans and HDFC seems to be in a comfortable liquidity position to benefit from these macros. It is undoubtedly a strong brand to hold in an investor's portfolio., Dixon Technologies, Dixon Tech is India's largest electronic manufacturing player and is currently witnessing a confluence of rising demand, import substitution and booster in the form of the PLI Scheme by the Government., Under the scheme, the company will get an incentive of 4 percent to 6 percent on incremental sales of goods manufactured in the country. The management also expects an eight-fold jump in its mobile revenues in FY22., Dixon is currently in the growth phase and undergoing an aggressive scale-up across product segments. This along with a backward integration model, fungible capacities and a focused approach will drive its growth going ahead., Being the only listed EMS player in the organized space, Dixon is richly valued however with a strong order book and a leaner working capital cycle, growth is expected to meet expectations in the upcoming quarters.Hence, Dixon can be looked at from a portfolio perspective., Marico, Marico is a robust FMCG player and one of the major beneficiaries of the unprecedented rise in the in-home consumption of products during the first half of FY21., With double-digit growth in its India business in Q2 and strong momentum in its Parachute, Saffola and other major brands, the company is on its path to deliver strong growth, especially from rising rural demand., On an international front, its Bangladesh business is clocking hefty volumes and the company also plans to replicate the same strategy in Vietnam., In the medium-term, Marico aims to deliver a mix of healthy top and bottom-line growth with 19-20 percent operating margins., All these factors bode well for shareholders who have been receiving an average ROE of 35 percent in the past 5 years and a dividend yield of 1.8 percent., Considering all the tailwinds, Marico seems like a good fit from an investment perspective., Ambuja Cements, Ambuja combined with ACC and the Holcim group is the second-largest cement player in India with an individual capacity of 29.7 MT., It has a stronghold in the North and Central markets and a respectable presence in the eastern markets which was the least impacted by the pandemic., Compared to ACC and Ultratech, Ambuja fared better in its Q2 realization levels. Moreover, the company has also undergone stringent cost-cutting measures to deliver efficient operational performance., Its next leg of growth consists of adding new capacities at Marwar and expansion in the central region., With the infra boost by the government, Ambuja seems to be well-placed to ramp-up a few orders and boost sales., To summarize, Ambuja is a cheaply valued stock trading at a one-year forward EV/EBITDA of 7 times with strong potential to benefit from the upcoming infra boom in India., Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

On the higher side, a decisive move above 11,900 levels would add further follow up buying in the index which could take Nifty towards 12,150 to 12,200 levels in the coming sessions., Here are two buy calls for the next 3-4 weeks:, HDFC Life Insurance Company | LTP: Rs 599 | Target price: Rs 644 | Stop loss: Rs 560 | Upside: 7.5%, For the last three months, the stock has been consistently moving lower in a downward sloping channel with the formation of the lower high and lower bottom patterns., However, this week the stock has once again moved back above its short-term moving averages with a breakout above the falling trend line of the sloping channel., The breakout can be seen with rising volumes and positive divergences on secondary oscillators., Bajaj Finance | LTP: Rs 3,483.90 | Target price: Rs 3,835 | Stop loss: Rs 3,200 | Upside: 10%, After testing the levels of Rs 3,749 in early September, the stock slid sharply towards Rs 3,006 levels and thereafter it recovered and managed to surpass its 100-day exponential moving average on weekly charts., On the daily charts as well, the stock is continuously holding above its 200-day exponential moving average which is placed at Rs 3,260 levels., For the last five weeks, the has stock has been consolidating within the range of Rs 3,100-3,500., However, this week we have observed a fresh breakout on the charts along with positive divergences on secondary oscillators., The additional volumes with rising prices suggest the next upswing in the prices., (The author is Senior Technical Analyst at SMC Global Securities), Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

Renewal premium collection continued to be strong, up 21% YoY to Rs 43bn. APE growth was robust at 21% YoY to Rs 21.4bn driven primarily by the savings business, which grew 27% YoY to Rs. 18.9bn. We expect HDFCLIFE to continue to outpace the private players going forward. Growth in the savings portfolio was led by the Sanchay Par product which saw strong demand through the bancassurance and agency channel. HDFCLIFE’s market share within HDFC bank stood at ~70% during the quarter. We expect the savings APE to grow ~10% in FY21. 1HFY21 growth was flat at ~2%. In the current lower interest rate environment, we expect non-par guaranteed products and the sanchay par products to be the key drivers. Protection APE de-grew ~10% YoY to Rs 2.5bn led by the continuous fall in the credit protect portfolio (down ~36% YoY in Q2FY21). Retail protection APE grew by ~33% YoY to Rs 1.4bn during the quarter. Sequentially, however, credit protect saw improving trends and the growth in this segment could revive by Q3FY21 as most partners are seeing disbursement levels at ~90% of FY20. APE growth coupled with improving business mix towards non-linked segment resulted in the VNB margin improving 130bps to 25.6%. Overall VNB grew by ~22% YoY to Rs 5.5bn. We expect VNB margin to remain flat at 25.8% for FY21., Outlook, Following the continuous strong performance and better outlook, we revise our estimates and recommendation for HDFCLIFE to “Accumulate” from “Reduce” in Q1FY21.

And despite COVID-19 severely hampering economic activity, markets consistently surged on better-than-expected June quarter earnings and on hopes of COVID-19 vaccine. Indian investor sentiment was also boosted by domestic liquidity, which continued to drive Indian equities in tandem with global markets., Even management commentary gave the market a confident outlook to withstand businesses against the COVID spread and its impact. With unlocking formulas supporting phased re-opening of economic activity, market started discounting the severity of impact of virus spread over businesses, going forward. But it seems like more businesses are dealing with coronavirus and markets have learnt to live with it., Here are sectors which we believe investors should focus on and invest in after June quarter earnings session:, Life Insurance a sweet spot sector: Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) clocked a sharp 40 percent month-on-month growth in individual premiums in July and August, led by a jump in the sales of big-ticket pension and term assurance plans.

We expect private insurance companies like HDFC Life, SBI Life and ICICI Prudential Life could see the same traction in premium collection growth., Defence sector stocks to be in action on the back of Atma Nirbhar Bharat boost: The procurements will focus on indigenous design and development. Platforms and equipment worth Rs 31,130 crore will be procured from Indian companies and they will be manufactured in India. In the last 5 years, India has spent Rs 3.5 trillion on import of defence items and expects the opportunities of Rs 4 trillion in next 5 years, hence defence stocks like Bharat Dynamics, Bharat Electronics, ZenTech, Cochin Shipyard, HAL and L&T are set to benefit., The real estate sector can see a boost in the coming quarter: The Centre makes a countrywide effort to push affordable housing and Maharashtra is considering reducing stamp duty on real estate from 5 percent to 2-3 percent in order to give a boost to the industry. The government recently appointed a committee, under the chairmanship of HDFC head Deepak Parekh, to make recommendations to boost the sector. One of its recommendations was to cut stamp duty by 50 percent. Realty & building material stocks to be focused in coming quarters.

Government has identified about 7,000 projects in different sectors that will be part of the National Infrastructure Pipeline.

This has led to a surge in the demand for term insurance, and we believe that the trend is likely to sustain,"" he said., COVID-19 Vaccine, Frequently Asked Questions, A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine., There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine., Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time., Track this LIVE blog for all the latest updates on coronavirus pandemic, The business has started to pick up on a month-on-month basis, and we are seeing higher traction, especially in the individual protection business, he added., Speaking about the company's communication strategy, which had to change due to the pandemic, Gupta said genuine empathy for customers is very important., “In the initial days, our role was to ensure that we remain relevant by engaging with our consumers and finding ways to assist them in taking the right financial decisions. Recently, we also launched a term insurance campaign to build awareness around the importance of protecting our loved ones in these uncertain times,"" he said., He further said it is important to have the right media mix to reach out to the right consumer., “Media buying and overall strategy need a relook due to the changes in consumer behaviour and consumption trends.

Customers have also avoided visiting branches as a safety precaution on one hand, while home visits by agents have also hit a pause due to societies not allowing non-residents amidst COVID-19 fears., The only life insurers to see growth in new premiums in May 2020 were Aviva Life, Canara HSBC OBC Life and Tata AIA Life., For FY21, data from Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) showed that the premium collection for the April-May period dropped 28 percent YoY to Rs 20,466.76 crore., COVID-19 Vaccine, Frequently Asked Questions, A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection.

The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine., There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine., Vaccine development is a long, complex process.

This was due to a drop in net investment income and a rise in provisions. However, both annualised premium equivalent (APE) and value of new business (VNB) saw a double-digit growth in FY20., The net investment income slipped into the red touching a negative of Rs 10,229.92 crore in Q4FY20 as compared to an income of Rs 3,755.65 crore in the year-ago period. Provisions for diminution in value of investments rose to Rs 375.85 crore in Q4 compared to Rs 17.32 crore in the year-ago period., Net premium income growth saw a marginal hike to Rs 10,475.95 crore in the March quarter compared to Rs 10,251.26 crore., For the full year (FY20), the annualised premium equivalent (APE) rose by 18 percent YoY to Rs 7,407 crore.

We believe that insurance remains a multi-decade opportunity with significant potential."", The 13th month persistency (renewal after first year) rose to 88 percent at the end of FY20 compared to 84 percent a year ago. The 61st month persistency rose to 54 percent in FY20 compared to 51 percent in FY19., In the individual annualised premium equivalent (APE), the share of unit-linked products came down to 28 percent in FY20 from 55 percent a year ago. The share of non-par savings products (savings products with no profits or dividends are paid out) rose to 45 percent from 20 percent in the same period., The Indian embedded value (EV) rose by 13 percent YoY to Rs 20,650 crore in FY20. The operating return on EV stood at 18.1 percent in FY20 compared to 20.1 percent in the year-ago period., The EV of a life insurance company comprises two key elements. Firstly, it includes the net asset value or the net worth of the company, which represents the market value of the company’s assets attributable to the shareholders. Secondly, EV also comprises of the present value of the company’s future expected profits from its existing business portfolio as at the date of valuation., As on March 31, 2020, the assets under management stood at Rs 1.3 lakh crore. Here, more than 96 percent debt investments were in G-Secs and AAA bonds., The solvency ratio stood at 184 percent in FY20 (compared to 188 percent a year ago) as against the regulatory requirement of 150 percent., What was the impact of Coronavirus pandemic?, For Coronavirus (COVID-19), HDFC Life said that an additional provision of Rs 41 crore (approximately 4,500 lives) has been made. This is over and above the policy level liabilities., Vibha Padalkar, MD & CEO, HDFC Life said in the post earnings call that the insurer had an impact of Rs 1,100 crore in premium collection (new business and renewal) in the last 15 days of March 2020 to Coronavirus-related lockdown.  Of this, Rs 400-500 crore impact was on the first year premium., The company is also assessing future scenarios of COVID-19 lockdown including one scenario some branches could operate as one-man operations. Padalkar however clarified that there would not be any job cuts., ""We are looking at various scenarios depending on the lockdown. Given that we are able to service customers largely through working from home, then might look at one-man branches. This means that I don't need that infrastructure. But that is nowhere on the horizon immediately,"" she added., Fund raising, HDFC Life Insurance also announced raising of Rs 600 crore of funds through issuance of non-convertible debentures in the nature of subordinated debt instrument. This said the company will be in one or more tranches, on private placement basis subject to receipt of regulatory approvals., In the post earnings call, Padalkar said that this is an enabling provision and will remove any possible restriction that could be there.",no time

The lockdown announced by the government to curb the spread of COVID-19 is expected to affect the business and earnings of these companies., According to HDFC Securities, the high base set after strong growth of 22.8 percent CAGR during FY17-19, slowing sales of NPAR products (compared to Q2 and Q3FY20), a slowing economy and finally the lockdown is expected to severely hit sales of life insurers in Q4FY20., While having a bullish view on HDFC Life, ICICI Prudential and SBI Life, KR Choksey said, ""The higher share of protection mix will lead to growth in value of the new business (VNB) for Jan/Feb-20 period. However, sluggish growth expected in March-20 and H1FY21 will result in lower VNB in the near term. Hence, we have factored in the lockdown impact on new business generation and have revised VNB estimates downward across our coverage by 4-13 percent versus previous expectations."", As per the latest data from IRDAI, new business premium (NBP) of the life insurance industry (Jan/Feb-20) grew 10 percent YoY to Rs 39,156 crore. Private players saw NBP at Rs 15,281 crore during the same period, a growth of 24 percent YoY whereas, for LIC it stood at Rs 23,876 crore, a growth of around 3 percent YoY., ""The abovementioned NBP data clearly indicated private life insurance companies expanding their market share during the quarter. However, the NBP growth for March 2020 will be impacted by the COVID-19 lockdown in March (generally the strongest month for life insurers) due to high dependence on physical modes such as agency & banca channels and small share of online business in overall business,"" KR Choksey said., In FY19, the NBP contribution for the month of March has been around 15/12/12/17 percent for HDFC Life, SBI Life, ICICI PruLife and Max Life, respectively to the full year NBP, which is reflective of significant impact of loss in business. Accordingly, KR Choksey revised its FY20 estimates downwards by 5-9 percent against previous estimates on topline., The brokerage also expects persistency levels to see some negative impact in Q4FY20 and expects significant negative impact in FY21 due to higher surrender claims from ULIPs (Unit-linked insurance policy) arising out of the recent market volatility., This is likely to impact ICICI PruLife having a high share in ULIPs (around 69 percent of annual premium equivalent-APE) followed by SBI Life (around 52 percent of APE) and delays in premium payment will also lead to lower persistency levels, said the brokerage., It also expects product mix to change as a result of low attractiveness towards ULIPs and guarantee products (due to low interest rates) and more towards high margin protection products., HDFC Securities said growth for private individual APE was lower at just 6.1 percent YoY during Jan/Feb-20 and additionally, APE growth will get impacted by the lockdown in March 20., The brokerage expects ICICI Prudential to report a total APE decline of 14.3 percent YoY in Q4 as the company reported a 9.9 percent decline in Jan/Feb-20 sales. ""We expect VNB margins to moderate to 20.6 percent largely due to lower than expected scale."", In the case of HDFC Life, it expects Q4 APE to decline by 5.3 percent, while SBI Life is expected to report Q4 total APE decline of 3.5 percent YoY., Overall, it believes the lockdown will have a significant impact on Q4FY20E and FY21 on both sales and earnings of life insurers., Contribution from March month was high in FY19 for HDFC Life/Max Life at 16.7/22.2 percent versus for SBI Life/ICICI Prudential at 13.2/13.2 percent. Additionally, HDFC Securities estimates around 40-60 percent of business in March is generated in the last 10-12 days., FY20E APE estimates stand revised downwards by 3.7-17.1 percent, with SBI Life least impacted (-3.7 percent) and Max Life most impacted (-17.1 percent), HDFC Securities said, adding lower scale would also result in slightly lower margins for FY20., The brokerage reduced its FY20 VNB margin expectations by 30-90bps across companies., In terms of NBP market share (on YTD-20 basis), within the private players, SBI Life market share stood at 21.3 percent, while HDFC Life closely followed with 21.1 percent market share. ICICI PruLife and Max Financial Services has broadly maintained their market share steadily at 15.7 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively. Overall, private life insurance companies commanded a market share of around 31 percent while LIC continued to dominate the sector, KR Choksey said., Going ahead, in terms of distribution channels, the brokerage expects a big shift towards digitalisation to acquire new business and processing of claims through mediums such as online portals, Whatsapp, Chatbot, mobile apps, email and call-centres., ""This will also reduce the overall acquisitions cost such as commission charges paid to agents and bancassurance channels in the near future; a positive for the overall profitability,"" it said., Given the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, the brokerage feels there is a likelihood of change in consumer behaviour which will understand the importance of insurance as a pure risk cover rather than just an investment product. This, it believes will lead to higher demand for high margin protection products in the future., Disclaimer: The above report is compiled from information available on public platforms.

Among the sectoral indices, Nifty Pharma, Auto and Media managed to hold the gains while Bank, Financial Services, Realty, Metal and IT remained under pressure., For the past two trading sessions, the breadth of the market has been in the favour of bulls, for every loser, there were more than three gainers., Nifty's weekly chart does not seem to be that promising due to its straight vertical fall but momentum oscillator RSI (14) is currently below 30 level and most stocks are showing significant oversold rally, so one cannot negate a sharp oversold rally in benchmark index in coming days., Once India VIX settles below 70 levels, there will be a decline in volatility., On April 8, India VIX, after hitting an intraday low of 46.97, witnessed a sharp rally of almost 10 percent from the day’s low point., Due to this sharp surge in India VIX, the market went through a roller coaster ride on April 8., We are expecting Bank Nifty to trade in a broad range of 17,000 to 21,500 level., A breakout on either side will give a classical consolidation range pattern breakout and will define the next level for the banking index., Current chart formation suggests Nifty may find major support around 8,300 level which is well supported with an upward rising trend line, which is drawn by joining the lows of March 24., However, on the higher side, the index will continue to face hurdles around 9,150 level. In the case of sharp short-covering and a pennant pattern breakout, Nifty may go to 9,650 level., Here are three stock recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:, HDFC Life Insurance Company | Buy | LTP: Rs 477.10 | Target price: Rs 540 | Stop loss: Rs 440 | Upside: 13.20%, The stock seems to have broken its last week’s consolidation range and is currently witnessing a pennant pattern breakout on the daily time frame., The 200-week exponential moving average is acting as an anchor point and is one of the main reasons for the likely short-term bottom in the stock., The counter has been forming a base near Rs 440 levels for the last few trading sessions which is supported by momentum oscillator RSI (14) which has rebounded from the oversold zone with positive crossover on a weekly interval., Traders can accumulate the stock in a range of Rs 475-479 for the target of Rs 540 with a stop loss below Rs 440 on a daily closing basis., ITC | Buy | LTP: Rs 178.60 | Target price: Rs 200 | Stop loss: Rs 165 | Upside: 12%, For the last couple of trading sessions, ITC has been sustaining above its horizontal trendline breakout on the daily interval., The stock is trading above its 21-day exponential moving average and also above its four-week consolidation range on the daily scale., This stock has been forming a base near Rs 165-170 levels for the last few trading sessions which is supported by momentum oscillator RSI (14) which has rebounded from the oversold zone with positive crossover on the weekly interval., Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 178–179.50 for the target of Rs 200 with a stop loss below Rs 165 on a daily closing basis., PVR | Sell | LTP: Rs 1,000.95 | Target price: Rs 820 | Stop loss: Rs 1,130 | Downside: 18.08%, PVR has breached its almost three-week-long consolidation pattern and is currently trading below its support level on a daily timeline., Majority of indicators and oscillators are negatively poised and looking week., The stock has drifted below its 50 and 100-day exponential moving average on the weekly timeframe, which indicates bears are in full control to push price lower., The counter is likely to underperform the benchmark index which is visible on the Relative Strength (RS) indicator on a weekly interval., Traders can short the stock in a range of Rs 995-1,008 for the target of Rs 820 with a stop loss above Rs 1,130 on a daily closing basis., (The author is Technical Analyst, Bonanza Portfolio), Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

29,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks-take-charge-as-chief-distribution-officersprivate-life-insurers_13538161.html,Banks take charge as chief distribution officers of private life insurers,"In December 2020, a mid-sized private life insurance CEO found out that their bank partner, a South India-based private lender, was in talks with a rival firm for a possible tie-up. It was a problem because the insurance company got half of its revenues from the bank., The CEO acted swiftly and met the top management of the bank to thwart a break-up. He was successful and after three meetings the bank agreed to stay 'exclusive'., The CEO is not the only top executive worried about his insurance company's dependence on a bank., Bank-led insurers including ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, HDFC Life Insurance, Max Life Insurance, PNB MetLife and SBI Life Insurance are among companies that have significant business coming in from one bank., Take Max Life for instance. A total of 55 percent of its individual premiums came in from Axis Bank which is its partner. Or PNB Metlife where Punjab National Bank accounted for 53 percent of the individual business in FY19. For Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance, a chunk of the business came from Karur Vysya Bank., In a decade, the share of banks in private life insurance distribution has seen an almost 100 percent jump, from 25 percent in 2008-09 to touch 50 percent at the end of 2019. In other words, half of a private life insurance company's business comes from just one bank., A heavy reliance on one distribution channel, namely banks, is beneficial for insurers by helping have higher-ticket-size policies. However, over reliance on banks also means that these entities would be allowed to dictate terms to the insurer but strategy change in a bank may also impact sales of insurance., , “For banks, insurance brings fee income. But this is not their core business and hence the focus is not big on renewals,” said a Mumbai based insurance consultant who also advises companies on bancassurance deals., Retention of partner banks is also a core focus for private life insurers, with higher-than-permissible commissions also being paid. The insurance regulator has also imposed penalties on multiple occasions for these violations., Bank-led insurers have an average premium of Rs 71,000, while a non-bank life insurer’s average premium was Rs 58,523, according to data collated from the Life Insurance Data and research reports., Bajaj Allianz and Tata AIA are some of the insurance companies who don't have huge exposure to banks., For private sector players, almost 52 percent of the individual new business premium comes from banks, as per Life Insurance Council data. With easy access to thousands of bank branches and their customers, bancassurance is the top-most option for insurance distribution., At HDFC Life Insurance, data for nine months of FY20 (9MFY20) showed that 55 percent of the annualised premium equivalent came from banks. For ICICI Prudential Life Insurance it was 53.1 percent, for Max Life Insurance it was 67 percent while for SBI Life Insurance it was for 69 percent., An analysis done by Moneycontrol showed that for the top five private life insurers, banks account for 46.4 percent of the total new business premium. Any drop in sales performance by banks due to a rejig in business strategy with rising bad loans and focus on core business would directly lead to a new premium collection dip for insurers., For listed private life insurers, this would mean an impact on their topline and also a possibility of this translating into erosion of its share price., Is it a concern?, In the past, there has been a concern about banks misselling insurance products to their customers in a bid to ramp up their total income., Moneycontrol spoke to three public sector bank executives at the branch level who revealed that they are in fact nudged to sell either personal accident or a basic term cover with every new account opened., “We tell the customers that the account opening process will be processed only if the insurance is purchased,” said a branch executive in Mumbai on conditions of anonymity., IRDAI data showed that out of 61,137 complaints filed against private life insurers, 45,294 complaints pertained to unfair business practices commonly known as ‘misselling’. Considering that banks command a lion’s share of the business, it is a fact that bank-led complaints would constitute a major portion of the complaints., Persistency or the yearly renewals of bank-led policies are marginally lower than the other channels. Data from ICICI Prudential Life Insurance showed that both 13th (post first year) and 49th month (post four years) in bancassurance channel was marginally lower than the other channels like agency, direct, corporate agent and brokers., For ICICI Prudential Life, data for eleven months of FY19 showed that 49th month persistency stood at 62.7 percent in bancassurance, while the figure stood at 64.9 percent in agency channel and 66.5 percent in direct channel.",no time

Data shows that the share of Ulips in the new premiums and annualised premium equivalent (APE) has significantly come down over the last one year for the top life insurers., Take HDFC Life Insurance for instance. For the nine-month period (April to December 2019), share of Ulips in individual APE dropped to 28 percent compared to 59 percent in the year-ago period. In the same period, the share of non-par savings rose from 14 percent in 9MFY19 to 52 percent in 9MFY20., Vibha Padalkar, MD & CEO, HDFC Life Insurance said that the company has been focussing on a balanced product mix. While the share of unit-linked products stood at around 33 percent for the quarter, she added that the company is comfortable with this mix., Similarly, for ICICI Prudential Life Insurance the Ulip share in individual APE decreased to 68.5 percent in 9MFY20 from 79.6 percent in FY19. For Q3, linked product business contribution to APE to below 70 percent. This was over 80 percent in the previous fiscal., However, NS Kannan, MD & CEO, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, said that apart from protection, Ulips are a focus segment., Protection plans and non-par savings policies have a better rate of margin than unit-linked plans. Hence insurers seem to be preferring a higher mix of pure term plans. Further, the recent stock market volatility has also made the Ulips unattractive among customers due to dwindling investment returns., When it comes to SBI Life Insurance, there was a rise in Ulip share on a new business premium basis in 9MFY20 to 60 percent from 49.7 percent in 9MFY19. However, it was a drop from 72.8 percent levels of FY19. Non-par savings on the other hand rose to 11.4 percent in 9MFY20 compared to 1.6 percent a year ago., Max Life Insurance which is the company held by Max Financial Services saw its share of Ulips in product mix come down from 40 percent in 9MFY19 to 37 percent in 9MFY20. Non-par savings rose to 20 percent from 6 percent in the same period., Bank-led insurance companies sell a majority portion of Ulip products.

To be eligible for exemption under Section 80C, the sum assured has to be 10 times the annual premium. This is part of the Rs 1.5 lakh limit under this section., But now, those who opt for the new tax regime will not be eligible to claim any deduction under Section 80C., It is likely that those earning annual income between Rs 5 lakh to 7.5 lakh could switch to the new regime and hence will not have any incentive to buy an insurance product., Though tax saving is not the only objective to buy life insurance, it is one of the motivators. Life insurers are hopeful that fewer people opt for the new regime., Kamlesh Rao, CEO Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance, said the insurance industry will be watchful of the implication of direct tax changes in the new tax regime., As soon as the new regime was announced on February 1, life insurers' stocks were hit. Currently, HDFC Life Insurance, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and SBI Life are listed on the stock market., Shares of Max Financial, which holds Max Life, gained 8.65 percent intraday today (against a 12.8 percent fall on Budget day), ICICI Prudential rose 1.69 percent (against a correction of 10.93 percent), HDFC Life gained 1.80 percent (against a fall of 6 percent) and SBI Life was up 3.12 percent (against a decline of 10 percent)., The high reliance on the fourth quarter for premium collection by life insurers has however come down. Since Q4 is when individuals buy life insurance to claim deductions, a major portion of the new premiums would come in the January to March period., The Kotak report said the overall business booked by insurance companies in Q4 was down to around 35 percent in FY19 from more than 50 percent in FY05., Mutual fundsOn the mutual funds front, fund officials said that the ones who opt for the old regime will receive the ELSS exemption., In the past few years, mutual funds have witnessed robust inflows in ELSS schemes considering that there is a lock-in of three years as against five years in life insurance., The assets under management of ELSS schemes stood at Rs 99,817 crore in December 2019 as against Rs 88,512 crore a year ago and Rs 80,891 crore in December 2017., ""If a large set of individuals opt for the new regime, then they will not go for schemes like ELSS as there is no exemption in the new regime,” said Jimmy Patel, CEO of Quantum Mutual Fund., Concurring Patel's view, Uday Ved, Tax Partner, KNAV said, “We believe more millennials may opt for the new regime to avoid the investment hassles as some of their investment burden is already borne by their parents. To that extent, life insurance and ELSS schemes may take a hit. Also, the new regime would not create more tax liability compared to the existing scheme.”",no time
