I am a beginner, having run marathons for the last 15 years across different cities around the world including New York, Berlin, Mumbai, Boston, Chicago, London, Amsterdam, and Delhi. Over the years my Personal Best (PB) finish time improved from 4:42 to 3:33 (Hour: Minutes). And a PB of half marathon at sub-100 minutes. I have gone through terrible long-lasting injuries and some epic failures. The last marathon, at Rotterdam in April 2022, I “Did Not Finish”. This is the second time I Did Not Finish a marathon race., The injuries and failures have taught me as much as my PBs. I draw learnings from every marathon experience which could be relevant to my career, business, and life in general., You are what you do repeatedly: Primarily, it’s training, however boring it sounds, which will see you through the finishing line. Organisational capabilities are built and competitive advantages are sustained by doing those essential activities repeatedly. It is still the good-old-fashioned hard work and discipline that will help you endure business uncertainties and tough times. Like following a 5-day-a-week running regime, starting at 5.00 am, there is no escape from rolling up your sleeves and getting your hands dirty again and again., Speed can kill your run, business, and career: Starting the run faster or trying to outpace a faster co-runner can lead to hitting the wall soon during the race or to poor finish timing. Similarly, an indiscreet move like accelerated expansion or enthusiastic spending on promotion, or exorbitant investments in fancy technology is a sure-short recipe to value erosion, delayed profitability, or employee attrition, due to fatigue and low morale, in the middle of the battle., Respect and adapt to changing conditions: Varying race courses or weather conditions are akin to dynamic regulations, changing consumer behavior, the onslaught of technology or local market conditions. A good run at the Amsterdam Marathon does not translate into a good one at the Mumbai Marathon and vice versa. Like for business markets, a successful stint in your last job may not necessarily be the same in your new job. Respect and adapt to different organisational cultures, norms, and protocols. What got you there, may not get you here., Prepare for Uphill but restrain during Downhill: Though as much as I hate uphills during the run, downhills have been the causes of my serious marathon injuries – at times kept me off running for several weeks, and months. Exuberance emanating from the perceived economic boom or a short-term spike in sales is typically followed by over-leverage or undesirable sales practices. Be mindful of the consequences of the increased risk-taking capacity and actions in good times or rather, perceived good times., Cramps are inevitable - Keep going: However hard you train, you are bound to experience cramps or severe aches during the marathon race. Many runners will agree that sooner or later they auto disappear or, at least, the pain intensity reduces. Similarly, both in career and business short-term blips are certain. Do not let a tough quarter or hostile conditions at work bog you down. As they say, this too shall pass., Rapid change is lethal: Many marathon beginners make the mistake of changing their running gear or their diet during race day which leads to sub-optimal race performance. Similarly, an abrupt and rapid change in strategy during a penultimate business period could be disastrous as it takes time for the entire organizational machinery including the sales force and operations team to adapt and synchronise the action. That is why many changes that look promising in the boardroom, fail to take off because the ecosystem was inadequately prepared for rapid change., Micro breaks are important even before you need them: Staying hydrated through the run will keep you going. Many seasoned runners know the importance of drinking water or sports drinks at a regular interval; in fact, doing so much ahead of getting into the red zone. Plan your breaks well in advance even before you need them. It will keep you energized through the journey., Know when to Quit: We have been brought up worshiping “Grit”. Being wise to timely quit can cut deep losses and keep you afloat. It was frustrating to quit the Rotterdam race at the 32 K mark, due to unbearable recurring pain. Had I continued, it is probable that my injury would have worsened to force me out of running permanently., Mental Fatigue overpowers physical strength: With exactly the same fitness level, a runner with mental fatigue or perception of exhaustion is slower than his peer who is comparatively mentally fresh. Leaders could curb mental fatigue by creating a fair and conducive work environment. Individuals could keep themselves rejuvenated by following passions outside work, traveling, music, reading, regular exercises etc., To run far, run together: As surprising as it may sound, running a marathon is a team sport. Eventually, being surrounded by the right co runners, family, friends, coach, physios, nutritionist, etc. gets you to the finishing line. Exactly the same in Business and Careers. Supportive workmates, family, friends, and mentors will unlock the best version of you. If you need to run fast, run alone. If you want to run far, run together., Note to readers: Storyboard18’s new Month In Focus initiative spotlights themes and topics that are pushing marketers to reshape and rethink how brands interact with today’s customers.

The concerns stemmed from the fact that agents won't be able to commute to distribute policies., Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance was also worried, but the fifth-largest private life insurer in the country was prepared to tackle this unprecedented situation., In an interaction with Moneycontrol, Tarun Chugh, MD & CEO, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, said considering that the pandemic had affected several parts of the globe, the company was better prepared.,  Tarun Chugh, MD & CEO, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, ""While we had a business continuity plan, this is something very different. But we were agile and were able to get up and running soon,” he said., COVID-19 Vaccine, Frequently Asked Questions, A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine., There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine., Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time., The insurer is a joint venture between Bajaj Finserv and global asset manager and insurer Allianz SE., For the April to February period (FY20), Bajaj Allianz Life collected first year premium of Rs 4593.36 crore, showing a 22.8 percent year-on-year growth., Talking about the business prospects, Chugh said it is difficult to predict impact of COVID-19 on the sector., Also Read: Live updates on Coronavirus outbreak in India, ""Everybody (in the insurance sector) is going to work on three scenario basis, best case, worst case and realistic case. It will take time to get back to normal. Whether it is July, September or January we don’t really know,"" he said., The distribution challenge, For the life insurance industry, agency is the major source of distribution. These individuals are the feet-on-street who visit clients and sell insurance products. But insurers have been forced to suspend face-to-face sales., ""The last 15 days of March accounts for almost 12 percent of the life insurance industry’s annual business. We realized that the entire distribution has to work differently and things need to be virtual (or aided virtual) and video-centric,"" he added., , Chugh explained that the company now has something called a daily choreography where employees are given training on how to divide their day and how to pitch to customers over call., “Insurance has a lot to do about personal connect. Hence, the company invested in an entire rehaul of the training infrastructure. Sales staff is being trained on how to pitch differently, how to strike a conversation over call and how to have a more empathetic discussion with customers,” he added., How is employee management being done?, There is a lot of uncertainty in the market about the future of employment since there is no clear direction about how COVID-19 will pan out and how long it will take to be eradicated., However, Bajaj Allianz Life is clear that it will stay invested in all of its 10,000 employees in the company., “Normally this is a time of the year when the churn happens in the staff strength. But we are going to retrain employees who are on performance improvement processes. Not a single employee will be  fired,” added Chugh. The company also paid salaries five days in advance in March 2020 (on March 25) to all its employees., Despite the lockdown, since insurance is classified as an essential service, all services are up and running., Out of its 10,000 staff, about three to five of Bajaj Allianz Life’s employees are required to go to office to handle the servers. These employees have special passes and travel to switch on/off the devices and servers., How are customers being handled?, Policy sales continues to happen online across life insurance companies. The only difference is that customers do not need to interact through any intermediary., Chugh explained that medical examination done before policy sales has now gone virtual. The idea, he said, is to waive lengthy underwriting processes., ""We have trained employees to medical underwriting using video. Customers talk directly to the underwriter and is willing to disclose a lot more. However, those will pre-existing ailments will need proper physical medical tests done which may not be possible right now,"" he added., There is also a perception that considering the mortality rate under COVID-19, more Indians will realise the need to have a basic life insurance cover., Chugh said that while there may not be an immediate demand, in the medium to long term, individuals will realise the need to buy a risk cover., “The shift will be towards guarantee-based products. How soon? We will have to wait and watch,” he added., In Charts | Economic impact of lockdown on Centre and states, Traditionally, the June quarter is a slow period for the life insurance sector. More than half the annual sales is done in the second of a fiscal. Even if the lockdown is lifted on May 3, industry officials expect revival in business to take another three to four months from that date., Follow our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic here.",no time
3,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/how-bajaj-allianz-life-insurance-reinvented-branch-services-through-mosambee-4221281.html,"Coronavirus impact | In a feet-on-street industry, here's how Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance has shifted to virtual sales","Digitization has disrupted every aspect of the insurance sector today, where everything is now just a click away. With customers increasingly seeking customized and instant services, it has become important for banks and insurance services companies to address their needs by adapting to digital transformation and to improve the customer experience., Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance is one such company which has been aggressive in taking leaps in digital transformation using modern technology to overcome technological challenges. It has become the first life insurance player in India to take virtual branch services to the customer’s doorstep through Mosambee, a virtual branch on a handheld device., Mosambee, a disruptive idea, Bajaj Allianz Life continues to keep customers’ life goals at the center of everything they do. The Company introduced the virtual branch services platform Mosambee to offer greater convenience to customers, by eliminating the need for customers to visit a physical branch and reducing the turnaround time in policy servicing., With digitization taking over every aspect of the customer’s life, physically visiting a branch for simple service tasks was being viewed as redundant. Hence the company felt the need for a disruptive innovation to provide customers a seamless service experience at their preferred time and location., Better customer experience and reach, Launched in November 2017, Mosambee offers the services of a virtual branch to the customers at their doorstep. Through Mosambee, customers can avail an entire range of services such as obtaining premium payment certificates, procuring account statements, paying insurance renewal premiums, checking claim status, locating branches, SMS services for updating contact details, obtaining fund value, account statement, bonus statement, claim status, and many more service-related queries. Customers can also pay their renewal premium via Mosambee through cheque, DD, credit and debit cards and other online payment modes., This digital capability has helped Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance eliminate the need for customers to visit a physical branch for simple service requirements. It has empowered them with the flexibility to service their policy requirements at their convenient time and location, thus utilising their time better., Through Mosambee, Bajaj Allianz Life has also been able to enhance its customer reach. Using analytics, the company has identified and tagged locations of customers where the company isn’t present through its branches. This has helped them record customers’ addresses and service them at their doorstep. The company is also better placed to identify suspicious cases during such home visits., Mosambee has helped Bajaj Allianz Life build a long-term relationship with its valued customers and enhance their experience with the company., “Customers are seeking more and more personalized and instant services hence it is important for us to be agile and innovative in addressing the customer’s needs. Our adaption of digital technologies in providing customers seamless services is helping us enhance the customer’s experience with us, and also in building long-term relationship with the customers in their journey to fulfil their Life Goals with us. Mosambee is one such initiative taken by us to provide greater convenience to customers, by making branch services accessible to them at their convenient time and location,” says Kayzad Hiramanek, Chief - Operations & Customer Experience, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance., Stepping outside the comfort zone, Using analytics and geo location, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance identified approximately two lakh households in an area of 15 km around its branches, where a branch person could proactively go and offer services to the customer at his doorstep. Mosambee enables the branch person to do everything on the field which he would otherwise do sitting in the branch., The foremost complaint of any insurance customer was that the insurance agent would sell the product and disappear and appear only to collect premiums., To address this, Bajaj Allianz Life pushed its local branch employee, to go out proactively and service the customers at their doorstep. This has especially helped the senior citizens. Through Mosambee, customers can update the address, nominee name, buy new policy, get premium notices, make payment and get receipts – typically what all he could at the branch can now be done online at his doorstep. Today, the branch is no longer sitting in one location, but spread across the location with the bank’s representative servicing the customer wherever he is., Business of Innovation, Since its launch in November 2017, Mosambee’s usage has increased over the years, at around 900 users today. Through this digital touchpoint, Bajaj Allianz Life has been able to reach out to many more customers, thereby improving the persistency ratio of the company. So far, the company has serviced over 150,000 customers through Mosambee and collected renewal premiums amounting to more than Rs. 700 crore, in addition to helping customers with other policy servicing features.",no time
4,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/bajaj-finance-bajaj-finserv-strong-earnings-that-justify-stock-rally-2748641.html,How Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance reinvented branch services through Mosambee,"Neha DaveMoneycontrol Research, Bajaj Finance is the best performing stock in the Nifty year to date (YTD). While Nifty gave returns of 5 percent, Bajaj Finance is up by 55 percent YTD, creating a staggering alpha for the investors., In fact, it has been one of the biggest wealth-creating stock growing 73x in last 11 years (generating CAGR or compounded annual returns of 48 percent). The stellar stock performance isn’t a surprise since the lender has an enviable track record of growing its asset book by 42 percent CAGR and profit by 62 percent CAGR over the same period., Given the strong outperformance of the stock, the questions that arises is should investors look at the stock incrementally and can it continue to do well? In our view, yes. The stock is expensive, but for a reason. Investors cannot ignore this business of lending to the aspirational mass, which is in a sweet spot., Quarter at a glance, Bajaj Finance , Bajaj Finance, one of the largest retail asset financing NBFCs in India, posted yet another year of solid net profit growth of 81 percent year -on-year (YoY) as per Ind AS (Indian Accounting Standards) led by robust loan book growth and controlled expenses. The loan book increased to Rs 93,314 crore, growth of 35 percent YoY. Adjusting for one-off short-term IPO financing amount outstanding in Q1 of last year, loan growth would be 39 percent YoY., Loan growth was broad based and was contributed by almost all business segments. Rural segment constitutes 7 percent of the loan book up from 1 percent in 2015 as company has increased rural branches & franchisees to 693, which is just below its urban network of 793 branches., , Cost to income declined to 37 percent from 42 percent last year as the base year had one off cost. Also, moving of housing finance business to a separate subsidiary led to some cost savings. However, cost are expected to inch up again as the lender continues invests for growth.  Asset quality improved with gross non-performing assets at 1.4 percent as compared to 1.7 percent last year. Despite providing as per expected credit loss (ECL) method prescribed in Ind AS, the increase in provisions was limited at 7 percent, indicating the NBFC was already following a conservative provisioning policy. The provision coverage on standard assets improved from 40 bps to 89 bps on transition to Ind-AS., In Q1, the NBFC transitioned to Ind-AS. This resulted in some financial impact as adjustments were done as per norms for the prior-period. The 2 noteworthy impacts are 1) FY17 net worth declined by 6.5 percent and 2) FY18 profits was 7 percent lower under Ind-AS as compared to the reported number as per I-GAAP. While there has been restatement of profit, it is purely an accounting change. It does not alter the underlying economic value of the business or key investment thesis., While the overall operating metric keeps getting better, we are most encouraged by the new customer acquisition of 2.07 million in this quarter, growth of 30 percent YoY. Bajaj Finance now has total franchise of 28.3 million customers., Bajaj Finserv , Bajaj Finserv Limited (BFS), the holding company for the various financial services businesses under the Bajaj group also reported healthy performance. BFS participates in the financing business through its 55 percent holding in Bajaj Finance and in the insurance business through its 74 percent holding in two unlisted subsidiaries, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company (BAGIC) and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company (BALIC)., BAGIC: Sharp improvement in combined ratio , BAGIC reported robust Q1 performance with its combined ratio now lowest among the peers. Gross written premium (GWP) increased by 23 percent YoY in Q1 driven by group health which now is the second-largest segment contributing 23 percent to total premium. Motor insurance continues to be largest segment with share of 44 percent of premium while share of crop insurance fell below 2 percent. We are particularly enthused by significant fall in the combined ratio to 90.2 percent, an improvement by 560 bps YoY, leading to underwriting profit., , BALIC: Muted growth, BALIC reported subdued Q1 earnings as growth in individual APE (Annualised Premium Equivalent) was soft at 2 percent YoY. However, a growth of 36 percent in renewal premium helped overall GWP grow at 18 percent YoY. While growth was weak, operating performance improved as persistency ratio increased across all time period (13, 25 and 37 months)., Despite improving performance of insurance businesses, Bajaj Finance (BFL) with 56 percent share, continues to be a significant contributor to parent BFS’s profitability. We like the insurance franchise housed within Bajaj Finserv and see upside to Bajaj Finserv’s valuation driven mainly by lending franchise and well supported by insurance businesses. However, given the fact that holding company structure has certain inefficiencies and awaiting clarity on Allianz’s stake in insurance business, we prefer Bajaj Finance over Bajaj Finserv.,  What will drive Bajaj Finance’s future earnings growth? ,  While there is macro headwind in form of rising interest rates and increasing competition that can compress margins, the micro business of Bajaj Finance continues to be very strong. Consumer durable financing business requires a deep feet-on-street and a considerably evolved risk assessment processes, stringent underwriting norms, agile monitoring and superior collection mechanisms.  With the usage of technology, Bajaj finance has succeeded in creating all of these and build a superior franchise with significant moats., Despite its high growth, Bajaj Finance’s loan book is only 1 percent of the outstanding credit. Hence, we see enough growth potential.  For instance, Bajaj finance’s existing customer franchise of 28 million is estimated to have around Rs 5 to 6.5 trillion of outstanding mortgage loans. Bajaj’s ability to on-board them as its mortgage customers can offer immense growth opportunity. Moreover, there is significant opportunity to cross-sell products.  Overall, we see earnings growth sustainable on the back of Bajaj finance’s vantage positioning and enough growth potential in the segment., The big question for investors: Is the steep valuation justified, the high earnings growth notwithstanding?, Bajaj finance’s stock is up sharply by 29 percent since our last earnings review note in May wherein we suggested investors to buy the stock. It is currently trading at FY20e P/B ratio (price-to-book) of 6.7 which is a significant premium to many other NBFCs., There is little room for a re-rating of the valuation multiple. But we feel the company can maintain high earnings growth trajectory in the near term which will lend support to the premium valuations. Having said that, steep valuation doesn’t leave much room for the lender to falter on growth or on asset quality., While the rich valuations demand caution, the business’s unique moats make it a must own core holding amongst Indian NBFCs. Hence, in the current volatile phase of the market, investors should look out for any price correction opportunity to buy into the stock., Follow @nehadave01, For more research articles, visit our Moneycontrol Research page",no time

What started as the sector's maiden buyout with Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC)-promoted HDFC Ergo general insurance company agreeing to acquire L&T General Insurance for Rs 551 crore on June 3 seems to be paving way for further mergers in the insurance segment.On June 17, the board of three companies — HDFC Standard Life, Max Life and Max Life Insurance — agreed to a merger of their businesses, and announced that they will be conducting due dilligence before they create a separate insurance entity., The deal is set to make HDFC Life the country’s largest private insurance company by individual premium market share.

Distributors of insurance products — HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and Yes Bank — will contribute more to the combined entity's growth, he said., Similarly, reports have emerged about a potential buyout of Allianz SE's stake by Bajaj Finserv in two joint ventures — Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. Industry experts peg the deal at Rs 10,000 crore with total valuation of life and general insurance business expected to be around Rs 40-45,000 crore., Declining to comment on the reports, Sanjiv Bajaj, Managing Director of Bajaj Finserv, told CNBC-TV18 that there is an immense potential for consolidation in the country’s insurance sector.

The key theme which has been in debate over the past few weeks is whether the government would continue to follow the revised FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management) targets as set out last year (Fiscal deficit at 3.5% of GDP in FY17 and 3.0% in FY18) or will the government look to extend the target yet again?We think that the Finance minister shall be walking a tight rope to manage the fiscal austerity path. Though the chances of a slippage from the FRBM path are high, owing to 7th pay commission payouts, but these would to a certain extent get offset by higher revenues.Impact of 7th Pay commission and OROP (One Rank one Pension): 7th Pay commission and OROP shall result in additional revenue spending by the government to the extent of about INR 1.1 lac crores ( including spending by Railways of about INR 30k crores). Net of incremental tax revenues, this translates into about 0.5% of GDP. We think that the government would likely defer a part of this payment into FY18 resulting in likely payout of about 0.3% of GDP in FY17. On direct tax front, the government shall go ahead with reduction in the corporate tax rate (from 30% to 29%) along with reductions in some exemptions, which should have a neutralizing effect. The indirect tax collections shall reap the benefits of higher fuel excise duties as well as increase in service tax (2% increase expected). Non tax revenues shall also be higher on account of the telecom auction next year. We think that the finance minister would maintain the fiscal deficit at 3.5% of GDP in FY17. We expect net market borrowing to rise to INR 4.8 trn in FY17 (FY16: INR 4.4 trn) and gross borrowing to increase to INR 6.5 trn in FY17 from INR 5.85 trn in FY16.The biggest worry in this year’s budget is clearly the roadmap for long term capital gains tax (LTCG). In India, equity market linked investments (shares, equity MF units, etc.) are taxed at 0% if the holding period is over one year, 15% if the holding period is less than 1 year.An additional important point to be watched is the spending on infrastructure and defense with the idea of reviving up the stalled economy. The ministry of urban development has mentioned its goal to set up 100 smart cities across the country well distributed across different states. A clear budgetary allocation towards setting up of these smart cities will go a long way towards bringing tangibility to the concept. Financial tangibility to the “Make in India” campaign is also keen watched.The government has recently announced that it intends to encourage the startup culture in India. Announcement of tax incentives towards the same along with the steps to ensure smoother and faster setting up of businesses with minimum red tape is the need of the hour. We expect the budget to act as a starting point towards the same. Most of the public sector banks are reeling under the dual pressure of higher NPA and low capital adequacy, which is resulting in cautious lending. The government is likely to set aside funds for infusion into public sector banks with the idea of shoring up their capital and improving the health of the banking system.The metals industry is reeling under the pressure of low global prices along with pressure from Chinese imports. The domestic steel companies are under extreme levels of stress and we expect announcement of import duties- already done in the form of MIP to safeguard the domestic steel industry. Pollution has proved to be a big worry for Indian cities. We expect the government to announce a “Cash for Clunkers” kind of program, where we expect the government to phase out commercial vehicles which are older than 20 years and announce tax incentives towards purchase of new vehicles in the form of higher deductions.Overall, we expect the government to announce additional steps towards reform which would translate into faster execution of the vision of the PM which would result in India being the fastest growing economy in the globe over the coming few years.",no time
